# Phase 1 Implementation Results

**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Goal:** Increase article acceptance rate

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Added 5 New RSS Feeds
**Before:** 3 feeds
```
- Financial Times Technology
- TechCrunch
- Reuters Technology
```

**After:** 8 feeds (+167% increase)
```
- Financial Times Technology
- TechCrunch
- Reuters Technology
- CNBC Tech
- CNBC Earnings
- MarketWatch Top Stories
- Yahoo Finance News
- Seeking Alpha
```

### 2. ✅ Added 6 New Google News Queries
**Before:** 4 queries
```
- Apple stock
- Tesla stock
- NVIDIA earnings
- tech stocks
```

**After:** 10 queries (+150% increase)
```
- Apple stock
- Tesla stock
- NVIDIA earnings
- tech stocks
- Microsoft earnings
- Amazon stock
- Meta stock
- Google stock
- semiconductor stocks
- AI stocks
```

### 3. ✅ Increased Image Validation Timeout
**Before:** 5 seconds  
**After:** 10 seconds (+100% timeout)

**Impact:** Allows slower CDNs and image servers to respond

### 4. ✅ Relaxed Content-Type Check
**Before:** Only accept `image/*` content-type  
**After:** Accept:
- `image/*` (standard)
- `application/octet-stream` (some CDNs)
- Missing content-type (some images)

**Impact:** Handles edge cases where images don't have proper headers

## Results

### RSS Feed Monitoring

**Before Phase 1:**
```
40 found, 0 added, 2 cached, 35 skipped
Rejected: 3 no-stocks + 0 no-image + 0 ads + 0 duplicates
```

**After Phase 1:**
```
130 found, 0 added, 2 cached, 108 skipped
Rejected: 10 no-stocks + 10 no-image + 0 ads + 0 duplicates
```

**Analysis:**
- **Articles found:** 40 → 130 (+225% increase) ✅
- **Acceptance rate:** Still 0% (all cached/skipped/rejected)
- **New rejections:** More articles found = more rejections (expected)

### Why 0 Added?

All articles are being rejected or already cached because:
1. **Cached (2):** Already in database from previous runs
2. **Skipped (108):** Don't match stock-related keywords filter
3. **Rejected (20):** 
   - 10 no stock symbols detected
   - 10 no valid/unique images

### Keyword Filter Impact

Current filter in `monitor-feeds.ts`:
```typescript
const hasStockKeywords = ['stock', 'earnings', 'revenue', 'shares', 'market', 'aapl', 'tsla', 'nvda'].some(
  keyword => title.includes(keyword)
);
```

**108 skipped** = Articles from new feeds that don't contain these keywords in title.

---

## Recommendations for Phase 2

### Option A: Relax Keyword Filter (Quick Win)
Add more keywords or make filter less strict:
```typescript
const keywords = [
  'stock', 'earnings', 'revenue', 'shares', 'market',
  'aapl', 'tsla', 'nvda', 'msft', 'amzn', 'googl', 'meta',
  'price', 'trading', 'investor', 'analyst', 'forecast',
  'quarter', 'profit', 'loss', 'beat', 'miss',
  'semiconductor', 'chip', 'AI', 'tech'
];
```

**Expected Impact:** +50-70 articles accepted

### Option B: Remove Keyword Filter Entirely
Let stock symbol detection handle filtering:
```typescript
// Remove keyword filter, rely on symbol extraction
// if (symbols.length === 0) reject
```

**Expected Impact:** +100+ articles accepted (but more AI processing)

### Option C: Improve Stock Symbol Detection
Use NLP or company name mapping to detect more symbols.

**Expected Impact:** +10-15 articles accepted

### Option D: Allow Duplicate Images
Remove uniqueness check for images.

**Expected Impact:** +10 articles accepted

## Performance Metrics

### Processing Time
- **RSS feeds:** ~35 seconds for 130 articles
- **Rate:** ~3.7 articles/second

### Resource Usage
- **AI calls:** 0 (all articles filtered before AI processing)
- **Database queries:** ~260 (2 per article: URL check + title check)
- **Image validations:** ~20 (only for articles passing filters)

### Cost Savings
By filtering early, we avoid:
- AI claim extraction costs
- AI verification costs
- AI forecast generation costs

**Estimated savings:** $0.50-1.00 per monitoring run

## Next Steps

1. **Decide on keyword filter strategy** (relax, remove, or keep)
2. **Monitor Google News results** (10 queries may take longer)
3. **Consider Phase 2 improvements** based on acceptance rate goals
4. **Add acceptance rate metric** to monitoring logs

---

## Monitoring Command

```bash
# Trigger monitoring
curl -X POST "https://api.news.biaz.hurated.com/v1/admin/monitor-feeds"

# Check results (wait 2-3 minutes)
ssh dbystruev@biaz.hurated.com "cd BIAZ-Finance && docker compose logs --since 3m api | grep 'monitoring complete'"
```

---

## Conclusion

Phase 1 successfully increased article discovery by **225%** (40 → 130 articles found).

However, acceptance rate remains low due to:
1. Strict keyword filtering (108 skipped)
2. Stock symbol detection (10 rejected)
3. Image validation (10 rejected)

**Recommendation:** Implement Phase 2 Option A (relax keyword filter) for immediate impact.
